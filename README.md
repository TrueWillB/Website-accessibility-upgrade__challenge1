## Changes that I have made to the code

- Changed various "div" elements to semantic elements for modernization and SEO
- Updated CSS file to match up with changes to index, prevented breaks from html code cleanup
- fixed broken SEO anchor link by adding ID to section
- Changed title to "Horiseon Social Solution Services" from "Website"
- consolidated CSS code, pulled together sections with identical formatting using commas to collapse down for easier future reading and editing
- Changed any #ffffff color references to "white"
- set universal style to color: white for text. No need to declare white for all text now, it can be done only when needed
