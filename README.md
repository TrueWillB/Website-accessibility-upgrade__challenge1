## Changes that I have made to the code

- Changed various "div" elements to semantic elements for modernization and SEO
- Updated CSS file to match up with changes to index, prevented breaks from html code cleanup
- fixed broken SEO anchor link by adding ID to section
- Changed title to "Horiseon Social Solution Services" from "Website"
- consolidated CSS code, pulled together sections with identical formatting using commas to collapse down for easier future reading and editing
- Changed any #ffffff color references to "white"

/\* Questions: When I set the universal declaration to white at the top,
then set the color in "footer" to black, for some reason the universal
declaration takes precedence. WHY?

What kind of code efficiency boost are you looking for? What do I need to do in CSS?

What exactly needs to be in the ReadMe for this project? Is it just the changes that we made? Or is it a readme for the whole site?
