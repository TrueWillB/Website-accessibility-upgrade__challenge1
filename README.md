# Website-accessibility-upgrade\_\_challenge1

## Purpose of this website

This website was part of a homework assignment for my Full Stack bootcamp course. The code for a website was given to us, and we were tasked with updating the HTML to include more semantic elements and accessibility features, as well as streamline the CSS for readability and future ease of editing. The original code can be seen in the oldest history of the repository, as I uploaded the original code unchanged to start the repo. I have also made general notes below indicating a general description of the changes that I made to the code.

## Changes that I have made to the code

- Changed various "div" elements to semantic elements for modernization and SEO
- Updated CSS file to match up with changes to index, prevented breaks from html code cleanup
- fixed broken SEO anchor link by adding ID to section
- Changed title to "Horiseon Social Solution Services" from "Website"
- consolidated CSS code, pulled together sections with identical formatting using commas to collapse down for easier future reading and editing
- Changed any #ffffff color references to "white"
- set universal style to color: white for text. No need to declare white for all text now, it can be done only when needed
